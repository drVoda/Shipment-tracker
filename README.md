# Shipment Tracking System

## Overview

This project is a Shipment Tracking System built with React. It allows users to manage shipments, view shipment details, and create new shipments. It expects a host with a compatible API on localhost port 8017. 

## Features

- Display a list of shipments
- Search shipments by ID, customer ID, or order ID
- Filter shipments by status
- Sort shipments by various parameters
- View detailed information about each shipment
- Create new shipments

## Notes and remarks

This project was done for the Hrvatski Telekom frontend internship. It lacks the feature to edit an existing shipment, and could probably be written in a more component oriented way. Mismanaged handling of multiple orders associated with a shipment - only the first order is taken into account when sorting, searching and displaying. However, I feel as though it manages to implement the most important parts of the task successfully.
